## Technology Used

- API using Spring Boot in Java
- Database Connectivity using MongoDB Docker Image

## Use-Case
For the more curious Astrologers who reference full natal and synastry charts, 
but are not yet fluent in all planetary aspects, google is your best friend.
However, when googling Astrological aspects, the majority of information is limited to 2 planets at most. 
Therefore, all astrolgers have to infer the information from a limited perspective.
This does not affect experienced astrolgers, but provides a barrier to entry for beginner/intermediate astrologers.

## How this API will help

- Working towards developing an API that can provide more detailed aspects than currently available from the main Astrological websites
- Eventually develop a client side phone application for easy access to the API  :iphone: 

## Current method used for researching Astrological Aspects VS The API

#### Googling Moon in Pisces in the 11th House 

1. Google what moon means
2. Google what Pisces means
3. Google what Moon In Pisces means for a clear understanding of their synastry
4. Google how the Moon reacts in the 11th House
5. Google how Pisces reacts in the 11th House
6. Attempt to blend all this confusing information together

#### Proposed Use Case for this API

1. Tap the planet (Moon)
2. Tap the sign (Pisces)
3. Tap the house (11th)
4. Read appropriately returned data (Easy :relaxed:)
